### 📌 **Introduction**

The **Automated Assignment Submission Portal** is a system designed to facilitate online assignment submissions,verifying for plagiarism, grading and integration with LMS (Learning Management System). To visualize the interactions between users (students, instructors) and third party system components (github, lms,Turnltin), an Interaction Overview Diagram was created.

### 🎯 **Objective**
The primary objective of the **Interaction Overview Diagram** is to:
✅ Illustrate the flow of interactions between users and system components.
✅ Provide a structured representation of automated processes within the portal.
✅ Help stakeholders understand the system’s functionality at a glance.

## 🔍 **Scope**

The Interaction Overview Diagram covers:
📌 User authentication and role-based access.
📌 Assignment submission process.
📌 Automatic plagiarism detection and validation.
📌 Professor creating assignment criteria and grading.
📌 Integration with LMS (Learning Management System).

### 🛠️ **Methodology**
To develop the Interaction Overview Diagram, the following steps were taken:

1️⃣ Requirement Analysis – Studied the functional and non-functional requirements of the portal.

2️⃣ Use Case Identification – Identified key interactions and sub-interactions between users and system components.

3️⃣ Diagram Design – Used UML notation to represent interactions in a structured flow.

4️⃣ Review & Refinement – Validated the diagram with respect to the interaction and the sup-interaction listed above.

### 🔗 **Components and Explanation**
Each component in the Interaction Overview Diagram plays a crucial role:

- User (Student/Instructor) – Interacts with the system to submit assignments, review code, grade.
- Authentication Module – Ensures secure login and role-based access.
- Submission System – Handles file uploads and submission tracking.
- Plagiarism Detection – Automatically checks for originality.
- Grading System – Allows instructors to review and assign grades.

### ⚡ **Challenges and Solutions**
**Challenge 1:** Ensuring smooth workflow representation.

✅ **Solution:** Used modular UML notation to keep the diagram structured.

**Challenge 2:** Understanding the concepts on drawing iod from scretch with respect  the understanding of the current situation and the project requirements.

✅ **Solution:** Reading, understanding how a real life interaction between user and the system happens with simple UML drawing. 

### 📌 **Conclusion**
The Interaction Overview Diagram provides a clear and structured representation of the interactions within the Automated Assignment Submission Portal. It serves as a valuable reference for developers, designers, and stakeholders to understand the system flow and make informed decisions.
